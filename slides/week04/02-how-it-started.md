At the start of the internet, web designers did not exist.

Designers at that time primarily worked in the print medium. They back then were used to a strict canvas - a rigid square or rectangle to work within.

This was considered the pinnacle of design at the time, and the developer's job was to match the designers mockup to "pixel perfection".
