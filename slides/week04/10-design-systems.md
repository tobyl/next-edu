More broadly, design systems offer the best potential solution so far.

At the highest possible level, designers and stakeholders create a style guide and developers and other company employees implement those styles in the company's products.

Done well, this creates a constant feedback loop - if the style guide does not cover one specific use case or product type, it can be expanded and the implementation will follow.
