title: Responsive design
---

[Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) coined the term “Responsive Design” in 2010, shortly after the iPhone revolutionized smart phones and mobile browsing.

At the time, it was common for websites to have a dedicated mobile-specific site, or at least a mobile-specific set of styles.

"Responsive Design" refers to the way we are able to build HTML and CSS so that it “responds” to changes in the user's environment. The most straightforward example is how we can modify the design and layout of the page based upon the browser window width.
