It was nearly ten years later that the term "responsive design" was coined by [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) and design on the web took a step forward.

But while this was a groundbreaking change, the design workflow was already solidified. The simplest shift at this point was for the designer to build a mockup for the various screen sizes.

To simplify further, a typical strategy for design on the web was to limit mockups to a maximum of three sizes; Mobile, tablet and desktop.
