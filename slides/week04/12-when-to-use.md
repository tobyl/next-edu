title: Which layout tool should I use?

<div class="panels">

As our toolbox expands, the obvious question is when to use each tool. This can be a difficult question to answer, since every site or app layout is different. But we can start with a good overview of the intended purpose for each tool.

One easy way to remember where to start is that CSS grid allows us to build layouts in both rows and columns, whereas flexbox primarily allows us to build either rows or columns.

<strong>CSS Grid</strong> is best for highly structured grid layouts. Product lists on ecommerce sites, large numbers of tiles or cards in a dashboard, etc. 

<strong>Flexbox</strong> is best for flowing content in a single row or column, especially with multiple elements of different types and sizes.
