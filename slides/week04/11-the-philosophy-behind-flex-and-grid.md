Before we dive in it is beneficial to consider the philosophy of these new tools. In other words, we can better understand how to use the tools if we understand the motivation behind them.

`Float` and `position` are relatively simple tools. "Float this div to the left", "position this div exactly here". Blunt instruments that developers use as a means to an end. In contrast flexbox and grid are far more elegant, often solving problems before they arise and helping us create beautiful, responsive layouts.

A great example of this is how additional controls exist in both flexbox and grid to automatically center items on one or both axes (horizontal and vertical).
