While not perfect, this workflow worked surprisingly well.

The reason for this was that while there were plenty of different screen sizes, everyone was viewing the internet on very similar devices - a computer monitor with a screen that had a variant of the most common aspect ratios.

No matter the monitor, it was either a square or rectangle. It was commonplace to build to a square, and then simply cap the maximum width of the page for wider displays.
