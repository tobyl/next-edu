title: A sensible approach
---

We've already looked at a sensible approach in this class for how to begin writing good selectors: The component approach.

If we think of the various elements on our page as components, our approach to styling our elements becomes simpler and easier to manage. In my opinion, this approach is the easiest for newcomers to understand and write well.

It's worth noting that there are several documented approaches to writing CSS selectors, including [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) which stands for "Block, Element, Modifier" and [OOCSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) which stands for "Object Oriented CSS".
