title: Styling the example

You'll note that the example on the previous page contains **NO** class names or IDs, which is absolutely fine! 

Let's say we want the page to have a yellow background, and the header and footer to have black backgrounds. Immediately this tells us we will need to add the `background` and `color` properties to our CSS (since the default colour of text is black, our text will not be visible if we do not specifically set it).

What is the least amount of work required to achieve this? This example highlights a potential CSS trap - what colour should we set our `a` link tags to be, and where should we override it?
