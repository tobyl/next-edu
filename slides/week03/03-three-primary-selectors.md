title: Three primary ways to write selectors

<div class="panels">
<div>

There are three primary ways to write selectors:

- Target the HTML element directly
- Target a class name
- Target an ID

There are valid reasons to use one or any combination of the above. Sometimes our goal is to add "global" styling, and sometimes we want to be very general in how we target elements.

<div>

```css

/* Target by HTML tag name */
h2 { color: green; }

/* Target by class name */
.my-element { color: green; }

/* Target by ID */
#my-element { color: green; }

```

</div>
</div>
