title: What is a selector in CSS?
---

Our HTML is our content, and we use CSS to style it. This involves two steps:

- Targeting the element we want to style. 
- Writing the style (the colour, the size, the position, etc.)

Hopefully everyone is familiar with at least a hanful of CSS "properties" - for example, `position` is a CSS property, `float` is a CSS property.

In this class we will focus on the first part, the targeting. Selectors in CSS is how we target a specific element.
