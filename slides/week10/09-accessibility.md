Another area where the browser can help us is accessibility.

It can be a challenge to make your site or app as accessible as possible without being able to experience it from the perspective of your users.

In Chrome we can switch to an accessibility view that shows the DOM as a tree structure, with each of the HTML landmark elements and any relevant ARIA attributes.
