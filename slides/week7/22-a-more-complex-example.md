In this week's content folder, you'll find a boilerplate folder with a common example of a fairly complex form (an e-commerce checkout page) in the HTML.

In this exercise, you will be styling the form and editing the HTML to create an attractive, usable and accessible checkout form.

Some things to consider:

- Remove default styling and create a baseline before you begin adding your styles
- Don't forget focus/hover/active states for your fields and buttons
- Test accessibility by navigating through the form with keyboard ONLY!
