Until now we've been making changes to our HTML and CSS files and manually refreshing the browser to see those changes.

This is to reinforce one of the things that I've always found amazing about the internet - if you have a text editor and a browser, you can build some really cool stuff.

But in a real world application, we have other aspects to consider. It has become common practice to use build tools that modify our CSS and JavaScript before our site goes to production.
