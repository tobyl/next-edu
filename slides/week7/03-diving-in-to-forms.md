title: Diving in to forms
---


Like many aspects of HTML and CSS, it’s tempting to see forms as very simple elements, with not much work required to create and style.

But as we’ve been discovering, we may need to pay special attention if we want our forms to be usable and accessible.

Forms can quickly become a pain point for users, so we do want to make sure we understand the potential pitfalls.

<div class="panels">
<div>

~~~html
<form method="POST">
    <input type="text" />
    <input type="submit" value="Go!" />
</form>
~~~

</div>
<div>

This results in:

<form method="POST">
    <input type="text" />
    <input type="submit" value="Go!" />
</form>

</div>
