We are familiar with the concept of attributes on HTML elements already - like the `href` attribute on the `<a>` anchor tag, or the `alt` attribute on the `<img />` tag.

We're also now familiar with some form-specific attributes, such as the `for` attribute on `<label>` elements. But there are many more, and some are quite useful.

You can find more about the [purpose and usage of these attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) on MDN.
