title: State in forms

<div class="panels">
<div>

As we saw in the previous example, state can be more complex than it appears. Unfortunately, this is equally true in forms.

In the example on the right, I am navigating the form only with the keyboard. Note how at every step it is immediately clear which form field I'm interacting with and what the value is set to.
