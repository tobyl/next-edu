Before we begin, it's important to understand that we can enhance the default form styling, or we can remove it all and replace it entirely.

In some cases, it is simply not possible to modify the default style of certain elements. For example, the menu that appears when we click a `select` menu.

</div>
<div>
<img width="250" src="../select.jpg" alt="Styled select" />
</div>
</div>
