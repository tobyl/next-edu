title: CSS editing
---

We use VS Code because we want an better experience while writing our code. We get features like syntax highlighting, code linting and autocomplete.

But currently, we're still writing code in our editor and previewing in the browser. Occasionally it can be useful to switch to the browser to do some CSS editing.

If we click the three vertical dots at the top right of dev tools, we'll see the option to "open file". This option allows us to edit any file loaded in the current site and see changes live in the browser. Very useful!
