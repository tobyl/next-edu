title: Hexadecimal colour codes
---

The system is basic, but surprisingly powerful. This immediately brings us to 16 million possible colours, a very wide range. The human eye can identify around 100 million different colours and colour shades. The system is even somewhat predictable, and with time you can become quite adept at remembering how to write hex colour codes without looking them up.

But who wants to remember hexadecimal codes in order to use colour??
