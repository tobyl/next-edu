title: A brief history

For a long time, our only choices for colour on the web were named colours and hexadecimal colour values.

Named colours are colours that we reference by name - we've been using these a lot this semester. We actually get a lot of value from named colours, because often we can just think of the colour we want and reference it immediately, such as darkgreen or lightblue. In total there are 140 named colours available.

However, this system quickly becomes cumbersome when we're considering more nuanced or subtle colour palettes, and so we can also reference colours by a hexadecimal value - six character strings that produce a specific colour value.
