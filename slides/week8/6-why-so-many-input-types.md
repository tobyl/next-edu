The difference between each input type may seem subtle at first, but there are some pros and cons to how we choose the type for our needs.

We might get validation, like we see when we use the email input. Or we might see different functionality, like when we use the number input.

Each tag has it's own purpose and it's own behaviours. You can read more about them all on [MDN's input page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).
