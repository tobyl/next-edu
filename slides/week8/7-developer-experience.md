title: Developer experience
---

We've looked at a small number of tools that are avaiable to us, but the important takeaway is that it's very important to focus on the "developer experience".

We can write code with just a browser and a text editor, but with a small time investment we can enhance the overall experience of building apps.

With strong, reliable build tools we can:

- Focus on the app, not the workflow
- Build faster
- Build higher quality apps
- Build more resilient apps
- Remove friction from our build processes
