Sometimes we need to collect a larger amount of text than would comfortably fit in an input (think of a comment field on a contact form, or a description field on e-commerce product page).

While we could technically increase the size of a text input, there is actually a dedicated element for this, the `textarea` element.

<div>

~~~html
<textarea rows="6" placeholder="Enter some long form text here"></textarea>
~~~

This results in:

<textarea rows="6" placeholder="Enter some long form text here"></textarea>

Note that in most modern operating systems, the textarea is resizable.
