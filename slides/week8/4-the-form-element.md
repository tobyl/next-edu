title: The form element
---

Like everything in HTML, there is a dedicated element for forms - the `<form>` tag.

The form tag wraps our form elements, but it’s doing some other important jobs. For example, once inside a form users are able to hit enter to submit the form.

Also like the rest of HTML, there are dedicated form elements available for each specific use case. Occasionally we may need to create our own, or repurpose existing elements, but it’s important to try to use the right tags and to understand the repercussions.
