title: Third party tools
---

So far almost all of these tools are in our editor on in the browser. But there is also a wide range of tools out there, many free, that we can use to help us build and troubleshoot our apps.

Here are some great examples:

<summary>HTML Validator</summary>

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) can be a very useful tool for beginners. While far from perfect, it can help us identify errors in our HTML with clear guidance on how to address the problem.

<summary>Generators</summary>

There are many areas of CSS where it is common to struggle once things become more complex, Flexbox and CSS Grid being the best examples. If you do a Google search for "flexbox generator", "css gradient generator" or any other complex CSS feature, you will often find a range of really well built tools.

<summary>Code samples</summary>

There are many online IDEs such as [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) where you can write your own code and showcase it without building a full site. There are also a ton of existing code samples on these sites too, which can be extremely useful. THere are also dedicated sites for quite specific areas - this site devoted to CSS-only [loading spinners](https://cssloaders.github.io/) is one of my favourites.
