Within Chrome dev tools alone we also have tools to:

- Examine the layers of our site (in cases where we are using `z-index` to stack our elements).
- Inspect our animations to better understand the timelines
- See unused CSS code
- Get a detailed overview of our CSS, including stats, colour and font info!

You can read more about tools built into Chrome on the [DevTools documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).
