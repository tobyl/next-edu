An important CSS concept to understand when styling forms is the `appearance` property.

If we recreate the example from the previous page, you may note that the form elements look different. This is because I recorded the gif on a Mac.

By default, form elements are styled to match the operating system, **not** any specific browser default. The idea here is that complex interactivity in web pages should not display entirely different to similar functionality in other aplications. We can see this in action when we inspect a `button` element.
