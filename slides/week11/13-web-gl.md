The WebGL API takes `canvas` one step further, offering hardware-accelerated graphics and animations.

Since it is impossible to use the `canvas` API without heavy JavaScript usage, it is outside of the scope of this course. However, you can see that creating and controlling graphics in JavaScript via the `canvas` API quickly becomes cumbersome.

There are many third party tools and utilities that offer a huge boost in capability and ease of use.

Two of the most popular libraries for working with 2D and 3D animations and complex graphics are [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and [Greensock](https://greensock.com/).

If you are building web sites and apps, there is a good chance you will never use these libraries or the `canvas` API. However, if you are more focused on media, animation or web-based games, you will probably be using these tools all the time.
