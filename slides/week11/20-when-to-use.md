title: When to use
---

The `transition` property is primitive, but can be quite powerful.

Transitions work best when there is some kind of trigger - typically when the user interacts with an element on the page. However, it is also common to use JavaScript to trigger a CSS transition, such as when the user has scrolled to a certain point on the page.

It can be tempting for new CSS developers to add animations to everything once they learn this powerful tool, but **show restraint**!

Think about the animation you're adding. Does it add value to the user? If so, how? For example, in a drop down menu, a sub-menu that slides down or fades in may help the user see a connection between the action they took and the end result.
