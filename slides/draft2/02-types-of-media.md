As the web becomes more capable and more interactive, we gain better and more flexible ways to introduce media to our pages and apps.

We've used images on our pages in several ways, but we also have the option to use audio and video too.

Each media type presents it's own set of challenges that we must understand before we can integrate them properly.

It's also important to understand that in many cases, we can and should use JavaScript to realize the full potential of some of these APIs.

For example, it is common to include an audio clip on your page and then use JavaScript to programmatically play or pause the sound.

Finally, as with everything on the web we must consider how our decisions affect usability and accessibility.
