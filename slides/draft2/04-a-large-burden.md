title: A heavy burden
---

This gives us the power to make our images truly responsive, exactly like our other HTML elements.

You might see having to create multiple images for every single image on your site as a large burden. However, for a lot of large sites with a lot of images you might handle images via a CMS (Content Management System) where images are uploaded via an admin interface. It is quite common in these cases to have the CMS automatically handle the creation of multiple images and even image thumbnails.

It is also possible to use a build tool to handle the creation and resizing of images if you are not using a CMS.
