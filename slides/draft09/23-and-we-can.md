The good news is that we can absolutely achieve this with some modern CSS!

Instead of thinking about colour the way that machines do, using hexadecimal codes or terms like RGB, we want to be able to choose a base colour and then adjust it's specific values to achieve a variety of tints and shades.

Unfortunately we still need to choose that colour via a numeric value - there's just no other way to do this from a programatic viewpoint. To do this, we'll use the colour wheel.
