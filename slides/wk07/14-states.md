title: States
---

This concept of "state" is interesting. We're actually quite familiar with the concept - consider the anchor `a` tag. We all know that links on the web display one set of styles by default and another when hovering - this is an example of element state.

<img width="375" src="../hoverstate.gif" alt="Hover state" />

This is actually just the most obvious example. There are actually four common states for the anchor tag:

- active (the link has been clicked)
- hover (the user is hovering)
- focused (the link is currently "in focus")
- visited (the link has been visited already)

These states are a big part of makes interactivity on the web so usable and interactive. We must remember to take these states into account when we build our apps!
