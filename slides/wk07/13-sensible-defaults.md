As always, the browser is doing a pretty good job of styling our form elements and ensuring they are usable and accessible.

This means that we must take care when modifying or removing default styling, especially if we’re not certain how the defaults are taking effect.

When we tab through form fields, we can see that the browser adds a clear visual indicator of the current active element. We refer to this as the field being “in focus”.
