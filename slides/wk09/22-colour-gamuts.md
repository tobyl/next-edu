To understand colour a little better, we can look at colour gamuts. You can think of gamuts as a visual way to describe the available number of colours in any system. On the right you can see a visual representation of sRGB (standard RGB) vs Adobe's newer Adobe RGB colour gamut. The outer shape represents the spectrum of available colours.
