title: Whew! So what now?

That's a lot of theory, and a lot of it you don't need to know to be able to work with colour on the web. However, a little bit of background gives additional perspective. You can read about all the possible use cases for colour and usage on the web at Google's [web.dev article on the subject](https://web.dev/color-spaces-and-functions/).

Let's stop for a moment and think about what we want to be able to do with colour on the web. Until now we've used one off colours, but in a real-world app we'll most likely have branded colours to work with, probably even two or three. We'll want to be able to reference these colours throughout our CSS, and it'd be really awesome if we could use tints and shades of those colours.
