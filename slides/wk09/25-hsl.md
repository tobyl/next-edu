title: HSL Colour
---

<div class="panels">
<div>

We select our colour using the colour wheel by choosing a degree on the circle. Obviously, this means the available colours are 0 - 360. This seems small, but it will actually get us a huge number of possible colours!

This colour is referred to as a "hue". Once we've chosen our hue, we can then specify two other values; Saturation and Lightness.

Putting this together we end up with a CSS colour function called `hsl()`.

Our browser can actually help us understand HSL colour values!

<div>

~~~css
/* Hue of 0 degrees */
/* Saturation of zero */
/* Lightness of zero */
hsl(0 0% 0%)
