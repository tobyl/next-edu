While Bootstrap itself is an option for developers, it's hard to deny that Bootstrap has helped to shape the web of today. A big part of that is thinking about the web in components vs designing an entire site or page.

In the early days of the web a designer would create the design, branding and layout of the page, and a developer would build it to match as closely as possible. There may have been some back and forth, but the designer was solely responsible for the overall design.

With responsive design, this process became much harder. How might a designer communicate what various types of content would do at any specific page width or on a specific device?

The answer is to think in **components**, rather than pages.
