By default the browser includes "focus" states for interactive elements - visual cues for which element is currently in focus. It is extremely important not to remove these states! Many users will consider your pages broken if they are unable to navigate via the tab key.

Another common pattern is the addition of a "skip to content" link as the first interactive element on the page. Consider a page with a large header containing marketing information. The ability to skip to the content is very important for accessibility.
