This can be overwhelming for newcomers, and even experienced front end developers have to read up and research the correct application of these accessibility features. Don't forget, the nature of the web is that we can build **ANYTHING**, so hard and fast rules about HTML in general, let alone accessibility aren't always obvious.

But consider also that this is not optional. In Canada and many other countries, accessibility is now being mandated for company websites. Your future boss (or customers) will expect your sites to be accessible, and there are fines in Ontario for companies ignoring the requirement.

As usual, MDN has a fantastic reference for accessibility and [ARIA roles and properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA).
