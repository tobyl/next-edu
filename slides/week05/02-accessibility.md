When we talk about accessibility, we're being quite literal - how accessible are our pages?

A very low level example is using responsive design to build for a range of screen sizes. Without responsive design, our sites and apps won't work as well on mobile devices - our apps won't be "accessible" to those users.

But that is not typically what we mean when we refer to accessibility; We are referring to users who have an impairment that prevents them from browsing our pages.

Developers tend to overlook accessibility - it is a secondary consideration, an afterthought. But building accessible sites is a superpower for front end developers.
