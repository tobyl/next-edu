<img class="lg-img" src="../html.png" />

In this image, I'm curious why there is a gap above and below the header text.

As you can see, I have selected the `h1` tag in the "Elements" panel, and the browser is highlighting the relevant area.

The browser also shows us a representation of the "box model", the means by which HTML elements understand their dimensions and position.
