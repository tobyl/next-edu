title: Some general guidelines
---

As with everything in computer science we can't know everything, and we can't wait until we know everything to begin building, the classic chicken and egg problem.

We can start building with some simple guidelines, but it really will be beneficial to revisit these topics frequently. We will be looking at some tools that can help us build and troubleshoot our HTML and accessibility, but for now we only need to bear in mind the following rules:

1. Always use the most appropriate HTML element for the job. For example, if you're adding an address to a page, use the `<address>` tag.

2. Bad ARIA properties are **WORSE** than none!

3. Consider how your decisions in HTML & CSS will impact blind or partially sighted users. A good way to do this is to read your HTML and imagine you were describing it to someone, rather than viewing it in a browser.
