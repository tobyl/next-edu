It's worth noting that we don't always need a secondary colour - sometimes a single colour well used can be as effective or more. Colour is very rarely about "more is better"!

Technically there are two colours used in the design to the right, but we typically ignore the background colour as a "choice". Consider the user's preference for a light or dark theme.
