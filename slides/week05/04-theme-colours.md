When starting out as a developer or designer, it's tempting to add colours on the fly, or to think about colour only at certain stages of the project.

You might have already built a website or app and just chosen some colours to use throughout. However, it is generally more beneficial to think about colours early and to do some trials and testing before implementation. Going through your half-completed project and revamping the colour theme can be time consuming and error prone.
