Keyboard navigation is incredibly important for both sighted and visually impaired users.

Hit the tab key upon loading a new page and the first interactive element on the page will be "focused". You can tab through every interactive element on the page this way. One critical point to note is that this works perfectly in HTML, but **ONLY** if we don't break this functionality as we build!
