title: Starting with a single colour

Something we can acknowledge very early on is that colour is both incredibly simple and massively complex. The colour wheel on the right demonstrates this. Are there any colours missing?

The human eye can distinguish around 16 million colours, but this includes shades and tints. The basic colour wheel is a representation of every one of the basic colours, without any combination of black or white.

Choosing a single colour as our starting point gives us a very easy, achievable goal with which to get started.
