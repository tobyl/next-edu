Colour plays a massive part in design and UI. You might think about colour subjectively - your favourite colour, your least favourite colour or your preferred colour for certain items, like your car.

But there is a science to colour, and there is a language to colour that we can understand and implement objectively.

Used thoughtfully, colour can help our users and evoke emotions and feelings when people interact with our apps.
