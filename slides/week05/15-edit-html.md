<img class="lg-img" src="../edit-html.png" />

We can also go one step further and edit the HTML.

Simply right-click on the area you wish to edit and select "Edit as HTML".

While we're here, we can also note that at the bottom of dev tools we can also see the relevant CSS for the element selected, even the default browser styles.
