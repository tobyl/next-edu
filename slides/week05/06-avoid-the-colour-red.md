While the topic of colour is broad with many subtleties, here's a pretty simple rule to follow early on:

**Don't use red.**

Primarily, the problem you'll have is that everything on your page will feel like a warning or error. There are other issues with the colour red though. For example, when using tints of red you'll end up with pink. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but there are emotional, subjective and even political ties to the colour pink.
