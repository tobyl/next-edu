title: Invalid CSS

<img class="lg-img" src="../invalid-css.png" />

We've seen this before but it's so useful it's worth repeating; The browser will tell us if our CSS is invalid.

Here we've added `float: center` which is not valid in CSS. The browser helpfully shows us this, and even shows us auto-complete suggestions when we try to edit the value.

This means there is no excuse for ever submitting assignments with broken CSS in them!
