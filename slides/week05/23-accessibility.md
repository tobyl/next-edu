Because it can be hard to consider accessibility, dev tools includes an accessibility tree inspector. While sighted users can scan the page visually, visually impaired users benefit greatly from being able to scan the page as a tree structure.

As a side note, the MDN docs are a great example of a data-heavy site with a strong focus on accessibility.
