title: An analogy

A good analogy for accessibility is how humans read English:

<p class="lead">dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage Ill have you this time Ill have you and without a backward glance at harry filch ran flatfooted from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him</p>

Yikes! We can read this, but it's painful and missing a lot of context.
