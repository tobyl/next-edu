title: Why Accessibility
---

The primary reason for accessibility as a starting point is that accessible sites are better for everyone.

- Accessible sites will function better for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
- Building accessibly ensures that all users can use our products (maximize business potential)
- Accessible sites handle edge cases better and provide better experiences to all in the event of bugs or glitches
- Building accessibly helps us ensure we are separating concerns better (HTML for content, CSS for style)
