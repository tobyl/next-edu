title: Modern colour technology
---

As technology moves forward we've seen higher resolution screens, even up to "retina" quality (a term used to describe screens where the pixels are so small that they are invisible to the named eye). But colour is an area that also moves forward with technology.

[HDR, or High Dynamic Range](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/hdr.html) is one of the most exciting developments in photography and monitor technology. HDR uses a wider range of colours, and thus can create much more vibrant, vivid images and colour palettes than the older RGB specifications. With HDR it's even possible to [display a colour brighter than white](https://github.com/dtinth/superwhite)!

Currently an HDR monitor will still cost you quite a bit more than a regular monitor, but the technology is moving forward at lightining pace!
