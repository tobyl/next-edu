title: What are selectors?

<div class="panels">
<div>

Selectors in CSS are how we determine which element or elements we apply style to. We've been using them all throughout the semester.

The name is intuitive - we're "selecting" which part of the DOM we want a set of styles to apply to.

Until now, we've used them in very basic ways - often by adding classes or IDs to our elements just so that we have a way to grab them and add styling in CSS.

Some example selectors we have used so far:

~~~css
a { color: red }

.my-links { color: blue }

#some-element { color: green }

header a, header button { color: orange }

.my-element div a { color: pink }
~~~
