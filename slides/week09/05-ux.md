### "What the user sees and feels, high level"

This one is a little tricky, mostly because the industry and the field are so new that the terms and related job descriptions are still evolving. Design and UI both tend to be fairly granular in their approach - you can design a page or an element, you can create a UI for a single specific purpose. UX is the term used at a higher level - outside of the design and the interface, what is the experience of the user **as a whole**?

#### Example:

An ecommerce site has disappointing sales, despite having decent traffic and users expressing interest in the product(s). A UX specialist might conduct testing to determine at which point in the process users are abandoning their purchases and determine the steps required to resolve.

#### Relevant keywords:

Happy, sad, frustrated, angry, impressed, satisfied
