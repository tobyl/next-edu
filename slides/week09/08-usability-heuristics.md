title: Usability heuristics
---

Now that we have an understanding of the various fields, we can regroup and look a little closer at the last area, usability.

The topic of usability in technology predates the internet by several decades at least, and thus is the area with the most significant data and research attached. In 1994, Jakob Nielsen, now of the Nielsen Norman Group, wrote a list of ten usability heuristics that have become the most widely-used framework for developing user interfaces.

We'll look at these heuristics and some other longstanding UI and usability resources, such as Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
