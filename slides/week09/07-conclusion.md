Depending upon your career path, these disciplines might be all handled by a single person (in the case of an entrepreneur), a dedicated employee for each (in small or medium-sized businesses) or with large teams devoted to each (enterprise).

These are deep fields, with lots of prior art and research. There is value in understanding the various aspects and it's important to understand that our industry is still relatively young, so there is plenty of evolution and growth that is yet to be seen. New disciplines and technologies (such as AR and VR) will prompt massive growth in these fields, so it's worth considering how these advances will affect your career paths!
