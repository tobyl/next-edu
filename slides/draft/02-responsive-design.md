title: Responsive design
---

[Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) coined the term “Responsive Design” in 2010, shortly after the iPhone revolutionized smart phones and mobile browsing.

At the time, it was common for websites to have a dedicated mobile-specific site, or at least a mobile-specific set of styles.

"Responsive Design" refers to the way we are able to build HTML and CSS so that it “responds” to changes in the browser’s window size.
