title: How to learn HTML & CSS
---

In WEB210 my goal is not to teach you HTML and CSS.

If this were the goal I would simply be showing you lines of code and syntax, which limits your learning experience to simply memorizing blocks of text.

<p class="lead">Instead, my goal will be to teach you how to "think" in HTML and CSS.</p>
