title: Penalty for Cheating
---

There is no warning for cheating in this class.

When I discover cheating in one of your assignments, the immediate result will be:

- I will file a formal complaint with the college
- I will do everything in my power to ensure that you face the strongest consequences possible
- I will cease grading for all assignments, projects and tests until the end of the semester
