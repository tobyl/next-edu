Consider the analogy of building in the real world.

There are many distinct trades involved in building, each with dedicated training and knowledge. But before any of that, there is the architect.

The architect is not the person nailing pieces of wood together, but they have a deep understanding of the materials and the big picture. They understand the process at a fundamental level.

The architect can become the builder more easily than the builder can become the architect.
