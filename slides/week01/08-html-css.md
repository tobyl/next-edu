title: What are HTML & CSS?
---

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This is a very complicated way of saying that web documents need to have some kind of structure in order for them to be understood by computers, and for humans to be able to follow a standard.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. A style sheet is a document containing a list of style instructions that correspond to elements in an HTML document. The “cascading” part refers to the fact that CSS directives “cascade”, or compound as they are added to the document.
