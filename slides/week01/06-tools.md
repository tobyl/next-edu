Humans do not multitask well (or at all). Instead, we do something called context switching.

Development, or programming is a single context. Design is another. Even as your skills improve, you will find that switching between the two is extremely tricky.

For this reason, a separate tool is a great way to ensure you are focused on design, not code. The tool we will be using is called Figma.
