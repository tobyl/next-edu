title: Figma
---

In the first semester, many of you learned about working with graphics in MAD101. The tools used in that class were Photoshop and Illustrator, two monolithic applications that are commonly used across many separate industries and disciplines.

Figma was born out of a need for a dedicated, collaborative design tool specifically for the web and applications.

In 2022, Figma was purchased by Adobe. Currently it is still a standalone app, but it seems likely that it will eventually be merged into the Creative Cloud suite of apps.
