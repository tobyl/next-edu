title: Bootstrap
---

Bootstrap was created by two Twitter engineers and was first released in 2011. CSS is an extremely powerful and flexible language, but it is not at all opinionated about how you should structure and build your styles.

At the time, it was common for CSS developers to build their sites and apps one line of code at a time, with design being figured out on the fly.

Over time, this leads to a very messy codebase and a very chaotic user experience. Bootstrap was born from the idea that designers and developers would benefit from a more cohesive workflow.

What started as a UI kit for Twitter (at the time) was eventually released as open source software.
