title: Class-less CSS frameworks
---

If you're looking for a little more than a CSS reset, but nothing as heavy or complex as a full framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind, you may consider a class-less CSS framework, such as [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/).

<div class="two-thirds">

</div>

Class-less frameworks are exactly what they sound like - only styling for predefined HTML elements. This can be a great way to quickly achieve a sensible, accessible CSS outline to build upon.
