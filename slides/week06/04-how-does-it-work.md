title: How does it work?
---

Bootstrap works by leveraging the built-in power and extensibility of CSS and JavaScript.

We include links to Bootstrap on our site and we get all of it’s styling and functionality.

~~~html
<!— CSS —>

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!— JavaScript —>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
~~~

We will need both the CSS and JavaScript to get the full benefit of Bootstrap.
