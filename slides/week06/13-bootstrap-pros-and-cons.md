title: Bootstrap Pros and Cons
---

While we've only taken a brief look at Bootstrap, we can already see some of the advantages and disadvantages. 

<div class="panels">
<div>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ready to use out of the box</li>
        <li>Opinionated ðŸ˜€</li>
        <li>Accessible by default</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Complex for beginners</li>
        <li>Leads to messy HTML code</li>
        <li>Requires lots of additional elements and attributes</li>
        <li>Opinionated ðŸ˜ž</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>

But there is one more big disadvantage that makes it a dealbreaker in many use cases (in my opinion!). Whether or not you know CSS well, Bootstrap is a tool that must be learned like any other tool. That means you have to know CSS **and** Bootstrap! Furthermore, if one person on your team uses Bootstrap, everyone is using Bootstrap!
