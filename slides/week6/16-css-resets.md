title: CSS Resets and micro-frameworks
---

There is one last category of CSS utilities we can consider if we want a quick boost for our dev experience - CSS resets and micro-frameworks.

Rather than implementing Bootstrap and getting a full CSS and JavaScript framework, complete with design, colour scheme and layout, we can use a small third party stylesheet that gives us a more pleasant, usable starting point.

The best example is the now famous [CSS Reset, by Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

Incidentally, you may have seen around the web a reference to the named colour `rebeccapurple`. This named colour was [created to honour](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/) Eric Meyer, and is named after his daughter who died at a very young age.
