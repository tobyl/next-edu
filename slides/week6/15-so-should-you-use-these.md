title: So... Should you use these frameworks?
---

The answer, as always, is **It Depends!**

My advice in computer science is almost always to focus on the basics and the fundamentals first and foremost.

Bootstrap and Tailwind leverage CSS at a very high level, so the more you know CSS the easier you will find it to learn a CSS framework. Additionally, you will want to avoid the trap many front end developers have fallen into, the trap of learning Bootstrap or Tailwind **instead** of learning CSS.

Another thing to be aware of is that these frameworks are opinionated about almost everything by design. Both have their own design sentiment, and although it has become common to buy or create themes for both, it is also a well known problem that many sites now simply "look and feel" like Bootstrap.

One use case where I definitely recommend a framework is for admin dashboards and simple unbranded web apps. It can be very painful and time consuming to build custom styling for these, so using a framework can give you a very quick boost in dev time.
