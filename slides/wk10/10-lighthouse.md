Beyond doubt, one of the coolest and most useful tools built right into Chrome dev tools is Lighthouse.

Lighthouse is an automated tool for checking the overall performance and quality of our pages. In the Lighthouse tab, we can generate a fairly extensive report of our pages that includes detailed information about problems on our page and possible fixes.

I ran the report on this app I'm now using to display course content. Uh oh, looks like I have a bit of work to do!
