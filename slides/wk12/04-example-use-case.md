title: An example use case
---

Let's use a very basic example; A simple button component.

We build our button, but next we decide we want to use our button at the bottom of a form. We also realize we need two buttons - the 'submit' button and the 'cancel' button. But uh oh - looks like we'll need to add spacing.

Great! We've fixed our problem and our button looks great alone or with another button to the side. Next up we decide to position our buttons differently for a different form - with our two buttons aligned to the far edges of the container.

Doh! Because we added a right margin to our button, when we align it to the right side we end up with a gap.
