title: Why so many choices?
---

As you'll see, there are a **LOT** of options when it comes to choosing a selector.

But why so many? After all, we've made it this far without using that many.

Well, actually, we've used quite a few different types of selectors so far. I've been sneaking them in here and there. A good example is the [adjacent sibling selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator).

But one of the reasons we haven't seen quite as many selectors so far in the semester is that we've mostly built single, small one-off components, such as a form or a card UI.

Once we're building full sites and apps, we'll need to truly leverage all of the built in power in CSS, and that means understanding selectors.
