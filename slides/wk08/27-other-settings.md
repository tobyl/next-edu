As per usual, we are using shorthand to quickly flesh out the settings for our animation.

But for beginners, it might be more helpful to go through and set each relevant property one-by-one.

Some of these settings will be familiar by now, but you can look up all the possible animation settings on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations/Using_CSS_animations).

~~~css
animation-name: stretch;
animation-duration: 1.5s; 
animation-timing-function: ease-out;
animation-delay: 0s;
/* direction can be 'normal', 'alternate' or 'reverse' */
animation-direction: alternate;
/*  */
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
/* fill-mode can be 'forwards', 'backwards', 'both' or 'none'  */
animation-fill-mode: none;
/* play-state can be 'paused' or 'running' */
animation-play-state: running;
