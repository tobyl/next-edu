title: Being specific
---

In the previous example we can see that as we give CSS more and more precise (or specific) selectors, CSS can better understand what style we actually want to be applied.

You can understand this more clearly by thinking about actual use cases in the real world.

As we build our pages, we might want to generally set the colour of our links on the page. In our navigation, we might want our links to be styled differently. And then we might want to indicate to users what page they are on, so we might want the currently active link to be styled to reflect that.

All the while, bearing in mind that for each link style we also must consider the hover, focus and other states.
