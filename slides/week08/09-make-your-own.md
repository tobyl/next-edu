title: Why not create your own utility classes?
---

You might look at Tailwind and see value in the concept of utility classes, but wonder if you could create your own and customize for your own purposes, you're not wrong.

Tailwind isn't necessarily doing anything especially clever - it is a set of classes we add to our HTML to provide consistent styling.

You might be right - large organizations obviously don't and shouldn't all just use Tailwind or similar frameworks. But you should be aware that building your own Tailwind is not as easy as it might seem, and if you build it then you are responsible for maintaining and documenting it.
