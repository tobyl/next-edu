title: Tailwind tips
---

Before we dive in, some general tips and guidelines we should bear in mind:

- Learning Tailwind does **NOT** mean we don't have to learn CSS! Learning and using **ANY** CSS framework will require at least a mid-level understanding of CSS itself.

- RTFM! Keep the Tailwind docs open while working with Tailwind so you can quickly reference and troubleshoot.

- Troubleshoot using the browser tools, the same as you would with CSS!
