At this point we can see that we can use Tailwind utility classes as an alternative to writing our own CSS. But we've only scratched the surface of the power of Tailwind.

One great aspect of Tailwind, especially for newcomers, is the wealth of preexisting material that can be found online (from both the makers of Tailwind and the community at large).

Consider the example of a [login form from Tailwind's site](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/components/forms#login-form).

Now, this is obviously possible using plain CSS and HTML - you can copy existing code from anywhere and it will work. However, copy/pasting multiple blocks of code in your CSS will eventually introduce clashes and conflicts. Not with Tailwind!
