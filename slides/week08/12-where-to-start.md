title: Where to start

A marketing strategy that predates the digital age is that you should have a mental image of your target audience. It's tempting to assume (and build a strategy upon) the idea that your target audience is "everyone".

But think for a minute about the potential downsides of this approach.

Not only is it impossible to successfully target the entire population, it wouldn't be viable anyway. If you imagine your company's resources in terms of dollars spent, it makes far more sense to spend that money only targeting potential customers who are most likely to make a purchase.
