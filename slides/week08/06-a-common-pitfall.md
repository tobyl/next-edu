title: A common pitfall

That was pretty easy! But if we look at the results in the browser, it doesn't necessarily look the way we might want (or expect!).

This is a common pitfall in CSS, and unfortunately using Tailwind will not solve this common issue. Newcomers to CSS often expect one or two lines of CSS to magically somehow create exactly the outcome they wanted. This is not the case, and it's probably a good idea to try to banish this notion from your brain entirely.

In this case we see our three elements bunched up at the top of the page, exactly as we would if we had applied the styling with CSS. THere are some additional steps we must consider - in this case, we have not told any of our elements how much space they should occupy!
