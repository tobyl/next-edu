Using Tailwind provides huge benefit to you as the developer, but the real power of using a framework comes from the ecosystem. Here are a few examples of community efforts and utilities that will help ou build with Tailwind:

- [VS Code extension](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup) to provide "Intellisense" for Tailwind classes
- [Tailwind Toolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/) offers generators, icons and components for Tailwind
- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) are world class!
