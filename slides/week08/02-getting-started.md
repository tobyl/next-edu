Last week we installed TailwindCSS inside out html-codespace repository on GitHub, and we tried adding some Tailwind classes to a simple HTML page so that we understand what Tailwind does and how it works.

At first, Tailwind seems like a big step down from building custom CSS. We have to remember the Tailwind equivalent of any CSS property and value we want to use, and we must refer to Tailwind's documentation constantly. We are constrained by Tailwind's capabilities and opinionated choices.

But, consider the pros! Our styling is applied in the same place as our HTML, so we only need to look in one place instead of two. Every class we add to our HTML is documented and thoroughly tested, so we have more peace of mind. And finally, there's a hidden benefit that you might not even notice in the early days - not having to name things!
