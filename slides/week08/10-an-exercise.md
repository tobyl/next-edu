As an exercise, we are going to build a very simple app that uses **NO** copy.

Using Figma, you will build an audio player app, like Apple Music, YouTube Music or Spotify.

Your app should have, at minimum:

- A home page
- A search results page
- An album view
- An artist view
- A view for "now playing"

Obviously there will be some areas where you will **need** to use copy (song/artist name, etc) but outside of that, your pages should have no titles, no text in buttons or any other form of textual communication.

You can research online or by looking at your preferred music app on your phone.
