title: Utility classes

<div class="panels">
<div>

As a reminder, everything in Tailwind is a "utility class". We can most easily understand this by thinking about our usual process of writing HTML and CSS, except **in reverse**.

Instead of writing HTML and then writing some CSS to go with it, we have generic classes that we apply as needed to our HTML.

<div class="mb-4">
    ...
</div>

This Tailwind class sets the margin bottom to the increment "4". Note that this does not refer to pixels or rems, but to [Tailwind's spacing scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale).
