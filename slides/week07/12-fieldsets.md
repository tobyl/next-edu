title: Fieldsets

<div class="panels">

One nice easy semantic upgrade we can make to larger forms is to introduce fieldsets. Fieldsets are a way to logically group our fields together. We can use the `legend` element to give our set of fields a sensible title.

~~~html
<fieldset>
    <legend>Your Address</legend>
    <!-- fields here -->
</fieldset>
~~~

</div>

As we can see, by default this places the legend quite nicely at the head of the fieldset. However, in general the default styling is quite ugly. Thankfully, we now know how to hunt down the default styling and remove/modify it!
