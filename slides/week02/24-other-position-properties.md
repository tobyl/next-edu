title: Other position properties
---

We can position elements in a number of ways besides the default of `static` and `relative` from the previous example. Here's the full list:

- static
- relative
- fixed
- absolute
- sticky

The `fixed` and `absolute` position work similarly, except `fixed` refers to the position within the browser window, and `absolute` is relative to the parent element.
