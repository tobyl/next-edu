title: Always be building
---

I struggled a great deal when I began learning web development, with one question in particular:

<p class="lead">If I don't know what I don't know, how can I ever build anything?</p>

Unfortunately, there is no quick, easy way to learn everything you need to know. It's tricky, but we need to wrap our heads around the concept that for every single project we work on, we will learn a little more and do a better job.

If I could give one piece of advice, it would be this:

<p class="lead">ALWAYS BE BUILDING!</p>

Build for clients, family, classmates and most importantly, yourself. Build fun stuff, silly stuff, new stuff and old stuff. Charge money where you can, but remember that building is learning, which has huge value.
