<div class="panels">
<div>

I cannot write every HTML element or CSS directive from memory, and I do NOT
recommend that you learn HTML and CSS that way either!

Consider the following CSS code - how long might it take to truly memorize the
declaration and all possible options?

</div>
<div>

```css
.element {
    animation-name: stretch;
    animation-duration: 1.5s;
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
    animation-delay: 0s;
    animation-direction: alternate;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-fill-mode: none;
    animation-play-state: running;
}
```
