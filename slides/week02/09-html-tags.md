title: HTML tags

This power will elevate our HTML to be more usable and accessible, and the only requirement is knowing that the `time` tag exists.

The good news in the case of HTML is that **there are a finite number of HTML elements!**

Additionally, there are now some fantastic, free resources we can use to quickly lookup HTML tags and how to use them properly.

Probably the best resource is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
