title: An example
---

Consider the following example:

```html
<span>Valentine's Day</span>
```

The `span` tag serves no purpose here other than to wrap a random string of text. There is no additional context here about the content.

```html
<time datetime="2024-02-14">Valentine's Day</time>
```

In this example, by using the `time` tag we can specify some additional information to enhance our content. Note that the `datetime` attribute is only valid on the `time` element.
