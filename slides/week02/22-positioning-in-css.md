title: Positioning in CSS

While floats have mostly fallen out of favour outside a few handy use cases, CSS positioning is alive and well.

Most elements in HTML have the default position of `static`. Essentially what this means is that they respect the flow of the document, staying where you expect them to.

However, we often have a need for an element to sit in an exact position. A great example of this is the menu button at the top right of this page. Note how it always remains at the top right, regardless of where the rest of the elements are in the page.
