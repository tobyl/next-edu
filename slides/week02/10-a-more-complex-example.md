title: A more complex example
---

For a more complex example, consider this simple blog post example:

```html
<div>
    <img src="blog-post-img.jpg" />
    My first blog post<br>
    Posted on April 21, 2023<br>
    This is the first blog post I've ever written, not very interesting... <a href="#">Read more</a><br>
    Category: <a href="#">Blah blah</a>
</div>
```

While not very easy to read, this is valid HTML. Furthermore, this will be completely readable in a browser. But we can do much better.
