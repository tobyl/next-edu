title: Some general HTML guidelines for this class
---

These are general guidelines, and there are exceptions. However, following these rules will serve you well in general as your skills evolve.

### Do not use tables for layouts

It was common, even mandatory to use tables for layout for the first 5 or 10 years of the web. However, today we have a whole range of tools that are better for layouts, such as flexbox and CSS grid.

### Do not use the `<br />` element for layout

There are times when using the `<br />` element is necessary, but you should never use this for layout.

### Do not use images for content or widgets

Especially in assignments, there is never a time when you should cut out portions of an image to use as content. When I give you a mockup or UI sample, the expectation is that you will build it with HTML and CSS!
