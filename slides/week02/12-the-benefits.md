title: Why should you do this?

At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Being semantic doubles the amount of code, and yet visually this looks almost identical.

However, consider the accessibility of each. Users who are visually impaired  might use a device (or software) called a [Screen Reader](https://www.cnib.ca/en/screen-readers?region=on) to describe the page.

Without the additional markup, a screen reader would see the page as a giant blob of text. With the added HTML, the screen reader can more intelligently read the contents of the page and help the user navigate around.

Similarly, we will want our pages to perform well for SEO, or other machine-reading workflows. By making our pages more semantic, we are standadizing in a way that will improve how machines are able to ingest our content.
