Like all good computer science concepts, css floats are particularly well named.

“Floating” in CSS is a simple way to allow an element to “float” to the left or to the right.

Note that an element set to "float" is not aligned, nor is it technically positioned.

<div style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #333; background: #f1f1f1;">
    <div style="float: left; border: 2px dotted green;">
        I'm floated left!
    </div>
    <div style="float: right; border: 2px dotted green;">
        I'm floated right!
