title: So what should you learn?

**Do not learn specific syntax - learn the concepts!**

There are simple syntactic concepts in HTML and CSS, and you will come to remember these and be able to easily write them from memory.

A good analogy for this might be a chef in a high end restaurant. They will probably be able to make a large number of dishes from memory, but good chefs document their recipes and refer back to them. For a dish they only make once a year, they will most likely have to read the recipe to refresh their memory.

What every good chef has in common is a deep, thorough understanding of the concepts of cooking - heat, seasoning and how to use ingredients well.
