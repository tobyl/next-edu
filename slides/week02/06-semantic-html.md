title: Semantic HTML
---

Another important concept we will return to throughout the semester is semantic HTML.

Semantic HTML is a term used to describe well written HTML that helps convey meaning and usage.

Consider the humble `img` tag:

```html
<img src="my-img.png" />
```

With a simple semantic upgrade:

```html
<img src="my-img.png" alt="A ginger cat sitting on a window sill." />
```
